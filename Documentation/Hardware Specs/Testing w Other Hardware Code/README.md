# Testing w Other Hardware Code

Nucleo Radio Interface Layout/Schematic: Helpful if trying to use the modem board provided by Nolan for debugging. Just a breakdown of layout/schematic.

Nucleo-AX-Interface: Information about modem board provided by Nolan. Wasn't really compiled by us but helpful information is in here.
TNC_Test_1: F446RE port of code to control pic modem board provided by Nolan. This was tested and certainly works.
TNCXSource16: "Source code" for the PIC controller on the modem board, wasn't very helpful to us but here it is. May or may not actually represent the code running on it.
