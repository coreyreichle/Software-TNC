## Notes

 This is a slimmed version of our original GitHub repo. If anything seems to be missing or is not clear, visit:  https://github.com/MrLordLeon/TNCMCU
  
  - Keep in mind this other version was our raw data base when working on the project for a class and has a lot of unecessary or intermediate information
