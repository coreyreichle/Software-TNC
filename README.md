 ## Project Description

 Open source, purely software TNC that supports AX.25.

 This is a demo of the project receiving a KISS packet, sending an AFSK signal and then another TNC is receiving the message! The waveform in the top left is a live viewing of this audio signal. It is a short message so not many data points are captured here.

## Notes

 This is a slimmed version of our original GitHub repo. If anything seems to be missing or is not clear, visit:  https://github.com/MrLordLeon/TNCMCU
  
  - Keep in mind this other version was our raw data base when working on the project for a class and has a lot of unecessary or intermediate information
